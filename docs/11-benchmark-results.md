# Benchmark Results

This document collects representative benchmark numbers from the reference platform. These are not synthetic best-case microbenchmarks run on an otherwise idle lab. They are production-style measurements taken on real hardware with real application behavior and ordinary background cluster activity.

## Methodology notes
- Numbers represent typical observed performance, not peak showcase values.
- Prompts were drawn from real product-style use cases: greetings, weather, long-form writing, research summaries, code generation, and operational assistant tasks.
- The CPU-only figures represent the compact-node serving phase before the dedicated AI worker was added.
- The Strix Halo figures represent the dedicated AI-worker phase after the platform, database, and serving path were stabilized.
- Apple Silicon adjunct figures are included as adjacent-endpoint context where relevant, not as the core cluster-serving baseline.
- Large-model and vision results are treated as lane-validation results, not universal benchmark claims.

## Hardware role comparison

| Lane | Validated role | Practical strength | Not the best fit for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strix Halo / Ryzen AI Max+ 395, 128 GB | OpenShift AI worker | cluster-side serving, GGUF testing, local NVMe model cache, repeatable benchmarks | acting as a raw desktop-only AI appliance |
| MacBook Pro M5 Max, 128 GB | Apple Silicon Linked Device | OCR, AI Vision, MLX/Metal, private image workflows, GPT-OSS 120B class tests | becoming a normal OpenShift worker |
| Compact cluster nodes | app/data/control-plane baseline | platform services, PostgreSQL, ODF/Ceph, routing, fallback | carrying heavy long-form inference as the primary lane |

| Gas price lookup | 45s -> 1s after fixes | 1-5s | 1-5s |

## Apple Silicon large-model and vision notes

The MacBook Pro M5 Max lane is included here because it changed what the product could test privately:

- GPT-OSS 120B class model routing was validated on the high-memory Apple Silicon Linked Device lane.
- MLX / Metal paths were the natural fit for Apple Silicon-specific model tests.
- OCR and AI Vision workflows benefited from keeping document/photo work on a private high-memory endpoint when readiness and policy allowed it.
- The product rule remained fail-closed: if the requested Apple Silicon route was unavailable, Nessa did not silently relabel a fallback as the selected model.

This repo does not publish hardware IDs, private route names, private prompt suites, model-cache paths, or connector internals.

## MTP Preview Findings

MTP benchmarking added one important benchmark discipline rule: compare like with like before declaring a lane weak.

Public-safe results from the current lab:

- an older heavy-quant Strix Halo test was slow and useful only as a stress comparison
- a newer same-family practical-quant Strix Halo test with current `llama.cpp`, explicit MTP flags, and Vulkan/RADV backend proof was materially faster in direct runtime and gateway controls
- the Apple Silicon MTP lane remained a useful owner-only fallback/witness, but it should not be treated as the strategic endpoint just because one early Strix test used a less favorable setup
- the full app route, not the raw runtime, became the promotion blocker when it showed route-contamination, first-token, or stream-finalization risk

The reusable lesson: publish direct runtime numbers only with backend/offload truth, and promote product routes only after direct, gateway, browser, fallback, and stream-completion proof all agree.

## Database migration impact
| Metric | SQLite | PostgreSQL | Improvement |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Bootstrap | 6-32s spikes | 42-94ms | 300x+ |
| Auth session path | ~5,000ms spikes | <20ms | 250x |
| Concurrent writes | single-writer lock | MVCC | qualitative step change |
| Tables migrated | 38 | 38 | zero schema-loss events |

## Streaming performance
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| First token | 4-10s | 0.3-0.7s |
| Token cadence p50 | batchy / inconsistent | ~21ms |
| Perceived responsiveness | "feels broken" | "feels instant" |

## Infrastructure observations
| Resource | AI worker idle | AI worker under load |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|
| CPU | ~3% | 15-25% |
| Memory | ~19 GB / 124 GB | 40-60 GB / 124 GB |
| GPU busy | 0% | 97-98% |
| NVMe model cache | little activity | up to ~7 GB/s sequential reads |

## Thunderbolt 5 direct sideband

The Strix Halo OpenShift worker and the M5 Max Linked Device were also validated with a high-speed Thunderbolt 5 / USB4 direct sideband.

Public-safe operational result:

- direct sideband throughput was materially better than ordinary LAN transfer in the validated lab
- large model artifact movement and validation payload movement became less painful
- the sideband improved the lab workflow without becoming a blanket routing policy

The public repository intentionally does not publish private interface names, addresses, or route mechanics.

## Interpretation
The most important takeaway is not that every number improved by the same factor. They did not.

The most important takeaway is that the platform crossed a threshold:
- long-form work became viable
- first-token latency became competitive with user expectations
- heavier prompts stopped monopolizing the compact nodes
- the application became much more credible as a daily-use private AI service
- OCR and AI Vision could use the Apple Silicon lane where it fit better than cluster-side serving
- the Strix Halo node gave OpenShift a real AI worker instead of forcing the app cluster to behave like a GPU appliance

That threshold matters more than any one benchmark row.
