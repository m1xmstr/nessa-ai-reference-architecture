# Linked Devices Public Pattern

## Purpose

Linked Devices are Nessa's public concept for private user-owned compute. This document describes the pattern without publishing Secure Connector internals or private routing logic.

## Product Concept

A Linked Device is a user-approved machine that can contribute local compute to Nessa where the product and account policy allow it.

Examples of public-safe device classes:

- Apple Silicon laptops or desktops
- high-memory workstations
- family-owned compute devices
- lab or developer machines approved by the owner

The current high-memory public reference is a MacBook Pro M5 Max with 128 GB unified memory. In the Nessa architecture it is valuable because it can handle Apple Silicon-native model paths, MLX / Metal workloads, OCR, AI Vision, private image workflows, and GPT-OSS 120B class experiments without becoming an OpenShift worker.

## Apple Silicon Reference Lane

The Apple Silicon lane is especially useful for:

- document/photo understanding
- OCR and AI Vision
- MLX / Metal model tests
- private image-generation experiments
- high-memory local reasoning tests
- multi-token prediction (MTP) preview inference when the runtime, model, and product policy all support it
- interactive validation before a model is promoted elsewhere

This lane complements the Strix Halo OpenShift worker. The Strix Halo node is platform infrastructure. The MacBook Pro is a user-approved private endpoint.

## Private MTP Preview Lane

MTP can be treated as a private linked-device inference lane instead of a default production model route.

Public-safe pattern:

- build and verify a current local runtime that explicitly supports MTP
- use MTP-converted model artifacts, not standard model files
- bind local inference to localhost or a trusted tunnel
- require authentication between the product connector and the local runtime
- expose the lane as an owner/advanced preview, not as a Basic-mode raw model id
- keep normal production routing unchanged until app-path proof is strong enough
- if the preview is unavailable, say so and use the current allowed local policy rather than pretending the preview handled the request

This makes the device useful for high-quality private experiments while keeping the product honest about route truth and fallback.

## Thunderbolt 5 Sideband Pattern

The reference lab also uses a high-speed Thunderbolt 5 / USB4 direct sideband between the Apple Silicon endpoint and the AI-worker side of the platform.

Public-safe lesson:

- direct high-throughput local links can make model artifact movement and validation-payload testing much faster
- fast local transport is not the same as permission to route private user data
- product routing still needs explicit policy, readiness, and fail-closed behavior

Private interface names, addresses, route mechanics, and transfer implementation details are intentionally not published.

## Trust Model

Linked Devices should be explicit and understandable:

- the user approves device participation
- the product shows whether the device is ready
- the product should explain unavailable states
- a device should not be used for another account unless policy explicitly allows it
- private labels should not hide fallback behavior

## Explicit Selection Versus Automatic Routing

Two public patterns are useful:

- **Explicit selection**: the user chooses a device or private lane. If it is not ready, the request fails closed.
- **Automatic routing**: the product may choose a suitable lane when policy allows. It still needs to report route truth and respect privacy settings.

Preview lanes can be slightly different: the product may fall back to the current allowed local policy when a preview endpoint is unavailable, but only if the UI clearly says the preview was unavailable and diagnostics record the actual route.

## Fail-Closed Behavior

Linked Device failures should not silently route across trust boundaries.

Good behavior:

- selected device missing: clear unavailable response
- selected model not installed: setup or unavailable response
- selected private image path unavailable: setup guidance
- provider fallback forbidden: no external send

Bad behavior:

- silently using cloud AI under a private device label
- silently using a smaller model under a premium label
- hiding a failed private route behind generic success copy

## Privacy Expectations

Linked Devices should follow these public principles:

- user-owned compute is optional
- private work should stay private when private mode is chosen
- readiness metadata should be minimal and controlled
- logs should not contain user secrets
- device trust should be revocable

## What Is Not Published

This repo does not publish:

- Secure Connector protocol internals
- pairing flow
- auth tokens
- tunnel mechanics
- sideband transfer details
- job queue internals
- heartbeat schema
- device trust scoring
- exact model routing heuristics
- implementation paths or local config paths
