# Learning and Family Safety

## Purpose

Learning / Homework Buddy is a core Nessa AI product pillar. This public document describes the teaching and safety philosophy without exposing proprietary lesson-flow logic.

## Product Principle

Nessa should help a learner understand, not merely produce answers.

Useful public pattern:

- teach first
- guide step by step
- ask what the learner knows
- give hints before final answers where appropriate
- anchor the hint or explanation to the exact visible worksheet problem
- correct OCR or vision ambiguity before building the explanation
- keep explanations age and family appropriate
- preserve student trust and parent trust

## Learning Modes

Public-safe capabilities can include:

- worksheet and photo support
- document support
- guided explanations
- similar examples
- step-by-step practice
- parent/tutor-friendly summaries
- resume honesty when a prior lesson or document is being continued

These are product outcomes, not implementation details.

## Trust Failures Are P0

For a family product, the following are serious defects:

- giving unsafe content to children
- dumping answers when the surface promises teaching
- pretending to understand a worksheet when OCR or vision failed
- repeating generic scaffold text instead of responding to the student's exact hint or explanation request
- losing context without saying so
- exposing private family data
- routing private learning content externally without explicit user choice

## Safety Themes

Public-safe themes:

- family-safe defaults
- stronger defaults for child profiles
- no training on private family work without explicit policy
- clear refusal and redirection for harmful content
- supportive response style for self-harm or crisis language
- zero tolerance for child exploitation content
- privacy-first handling of worksheets, photos, and documents

## What Is Not Published

This repo does not publish:

- exact pedagogical prompt chains
- worksheet parsers
- solution heuristics
- anti-cheat logic
- lesson-state schema
- tutor flow mechanics
- hidden prompts
- specific child/family data
- private Learning telemetry
