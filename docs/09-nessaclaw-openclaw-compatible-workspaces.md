# NessaClaw and OpenClaw-Compatible Workspaces

> **Archived capability pattern:** NessaClaw/OpenClaw-compatible workspaces are not part of the current ordinary-user TryNessa offer. This page preserves a public-safe design and attribution reference for possible future owner-only requalification. See [CURRENT_PRODUCT_BOUNDARY.md](./CURRENT_PRODUCT_BOUNDARY.md).

## Purpose

This document explains NessaClaw in public-safe terms.

NessaClaw was the product name used for a guarded private agent-workspace experiment.

OpenClaw is an upstream open-source project. Nessa references it plainly and does not claim ownership of it.

Upstream link: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw

## Naming

Use:

- **NessaClaw** for the Nessa product surface
- **OpenClaw** for the upstream project
- **OpenClaw-compatible infrastructure** for the compatibility layer

Do not imply that Nessa owns upstream OpenClaw.

## Public-Safe Product Model

The historical positioning was: NessaClaw is private agent workspaces powered by TryNessa guardrails and OpenClaw-compatible infrastructure.

The user interacts with Nessa:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  User["User"] --> Nessa["Nessa auth, entitlement, policy"]
  Nessa --> Gate["Allowed, approval-required, or blocked"]
  Gate --> Workspace["Private workspace boundary"]
  Workspace --> Safe["Safe WebChat and read-only skills"]
  Workspace --> Audit["Audit, storage, kill switch"]
  Audit --> Nessa
  Nessa --> User
```

## Current Public Truth

The public docs may describe the current canary posture:

- owner/admin canary first
- Nessa is the control plane
- no raw public OpenClaw route
- user never talks directly to raw OpenClaw
- isolated workspace model
- safe WebChat and read-only skills first
- high-impact tools locked
- audit, kill switch, and storage controls are part of the product boundary

## Guardrail Model

Nessa decides whether an agent task is:

- allowed
- approval-required
- blocked
- unavailable

High-impact categories stay locked unless separately designed, approved, and validated.

Examples of high-impact categories:

- shell or real machine access
- browser form submission
- purchases or payments
- email or external messaging sends
- Smart Home control
- file deletion or destructive workflows

## OpenClaw Attribution

OpenClaw is an open-source project.

In the archived pattern, NessaClaw was TryNessa's guarded layer around authentication, policy, storage, audit, safety, and workspace controls.

If any OpenClaw-derived code, manifests, docs, or examples are copied or adapted into this repo, preserve upstream copyright and MIT license notices.
